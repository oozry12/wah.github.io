## share my own time

- 13:00~14:00 no need to care about my head teacher job.Just have a rest.

- 22:00~6:30 time for reading my favorite book ,enjoy the music and sleep with heart and soul.

- In my office,take a headphones for doing my reviewing textbook.

## buy more fruits and milk

- buy fruits on Monday.No fruits,no health.
- buy milk and other little chocolate at the nearby supermarket twice a week.
- buy small lovely items online to enrich daily life.

## do exercises

- badminton.Once a week with my colleague.
- running.In the playground,music night.
- go to gym.Never late.Fitness is now now now.
